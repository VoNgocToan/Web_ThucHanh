        <p id="a1"> Thanks to everyone who made Fiddler on the Roof Jr. such a smashing success!</p>
        <p> After all of the hard work on rehearsals and set building and promotion, it really paid off. I have gotten so many comments on your wonderful performances.</p>
        <p>I've started putting up a <ins id="a2"> slide show </ins> of the production. Please feel free to download the files from the Web site. If you want high resolution photos on a photo CD, please contact me.</p>
        <p> Once again: <span style="color:brown"><i>BRAVO!!!</i></span> -- Mrs. Juroszek</p>
